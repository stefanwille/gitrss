RSS feed for git commits. 

For those who don't put all their repos on Github, this script generates an RSS feed. Put this script in a git post-receive hook like so:

<pre>
ruby /home/git/tools/gitrss/gitrss.rb /home/git/my-repo.git my-repo.git >/home/www-data/sites/gitrss.mysite.com/my-repo.rss 
</pre>

Then point your Apache to the directory where gitrss.rb writes its output to. After the next commit, you can subscribe to your RSS feed with any modern RSS reader.
